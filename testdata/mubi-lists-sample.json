    "description": "<p>Do click on Read More and the links. Thanks to all following this surprisingly popular list of important, critically admired and well known directors. A pantheon first, alphabetically from Bergman to Welles, the rest in changing order. And a few personal wild cards. Of course in time more women will be included (the only two so far are both from Belgium, land of my heroine Andrée Dumon). Modern directors will be more prominent too, and I expect more from Latin America, neglected countries and regions.</p>\n<p>Anyway, the 100

    "description": "<p>Click on the links. <a href=\"http://circeo59.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/le-rayon-vert-13.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Green Ray</a></p>\n<p>“<strong>The most thematically and stylistically consistent investigator of human desire in cinema history</strong>” (Geoff Andrew)</p>\n<p>—</p>\n<p><strong>My favourites</strong>:</p>\n<p><strong>The Green Ray</strong>,<br>\n<strong>Claire’s Knee</strong>,<br>\n<strong>My Night with Maud</strong>,<br>\n<strong>My Girlfriend’s Boyfriend</strong>.</p>\n<p>Rohmer was so consistent that there’s not much to choose between the rest of the features- Le Signe du Lion the first. The list, including various less well known shorts, is in chronological order. His final film was The Romance of Astrée and Celadon; after that i’ve listed tributes and films by other directors with Rohmeresque qualities, including Charlotte and Veronique which he scripted for Godard.</p>\n<p>—</p>\n<p>Rohmer was as dextrous as an expert spider, weaving tales as light as gossamer. As a film-maker he was also a gardener, a lover of nature, a careful tender of young plants, yet happy to allow the freedom to grow and wander too (improvisation in The Green Ray adds to its natural yet magical reality); master of colour and the seasons, and in summer especially the results are glorious.</p>\n<p>A philosopher, muser on fate, free will, temptation and moral choices, ever youthful in spirit, eager to follow his own path and yet able to spring daring surprises to the end. Who else in France these days would have shown the Revolution from the point of view of the Aristocrats? Which film is like Romance of Astrea and Celadon, a tale of young love’s misunderstandings in the time of the druids, seen from the pastoral courtly perspective of a 16th century novelist? Here we have a combination of his trademark young relationships and something of the stylisation of his occasional period films- he appears as much at ease with ages of enlightenment, chivalry and Limbourg brothers’ paintings, e.g <a href=\"https://uploads6.wikiart.org/images/limbourg-brothers/september.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> as the modern era.</p>\n<p>A Catholic, looking down now from a better place. A gallant courtly knight, with a romantic soul to match his intellect and a healthy interest in and respect for women; they are worth getting to know and care about. A lover of the sensuous too; more eroticism in a knee being caressed than any amount of Hollywood grunting and grandstanding. As Gilbert Adair has pointed out, his scripts are much more sophisticated than his characters’ dialogue. And as Geoff Andrew says, Rohmer “exposes the frailty of intention and the erroneous vanity of self-image”. His characters have their foibles- their proclamations and babbling often undercut by their actions or the reality we know better than they- but few are judged harshly, as his observational style has an underlying warmth.</p>\n<p>Rohmer’s films are more cinematic than often credited- the dialogue an extra layer or counterpoint  to what he shows visually, as well as a vehicle for the expression of ideas. And he was acutely attuned to the sounds of nature and the street, to the small gestures, glances and details in relationships. See his films alongside Guerin’s In the City of Sylvia which has been widely praised as pure and cinematic, and which even before i saw The Baker Girl of Monceau, i could see was indebted to Rohmer.</p>\n<p>A modest man, of wide-ranging abilities (novelist and teacher too), content not to broadcast himself with an ego-boosting megaphone, but quietly- so quietly that apparently his own mother was unaware he was a world famous director (he did change his name for that role). In his 1951 short Charlotte et son Steak, not released till 1960, you can see the New Wave coming. He was the mature quiet man of the Nouvelle Vague, and before that a crucial figure in the history of film criticism, editor of the still influential Cahiers du Cinéma as it challenged the world order.</p>\n<p><sub>~</sub>~</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://media.timeout.com/images/resizeBestFit/63517/660/370/image.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">My Night at Maud’s</a></p>\n<p><sub>~</sub>~</p>\n<p>Rohmer’s 10 favourite films in 1962:</p>\n<p>True Heart Susie<br>\nThe General<br>\nSunrise<br>\nRules of the Game<br>\nIvan the Terrible<br>\nVoyage to Italy<br>\nRed River<br>\nVertigo<br>\nPickpocket<br>\nLa Pyramide Humaine</p>\n<p>—~</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2003/great-%E2%80%8Bdirectors/rohmer/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SENSES OF CINEMA ARTICLE</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mubi.com/notebook/posts/close-up-on-eric-rohmers-the-green-ray-an-interview-with-marie-riviere#comment-15858\" rel=\"nofollow\">MUBI INTERVIEW WITH MARIE RIVIERE, ON THE GREEN RAY</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://medias.unifrance.org/medias/0/120/30720/format_page/stephanie-crayencour-the-romance-of-astrea-and-celadon.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Romance of Astrea and Celadon</a></p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>Kuxa Kanema has conducted a June 2013 poll of mubi users’ Rohmer favourites, and these were the results:</p>\n<p>1.My Night at Maud’s 103 pts<br>\n2.Claire’s Knee, 83<br>\n3.The Green Ray, 73<br>\n4.La Collectionneuse, 53<br>\n5.Love In the Afternoon, 51<br>\n6=.Pauline At the Beach, 47<br>\nThe Aviator’s Wife, 47<br>\n8.

    "description": "<p>Iran has given us one of the world’s great civilisations and a noble cinema too, many films of humanity and intelligence. Common themes include children, the role of women and- in the case of the most critically admired director Kiarostami in particular-, film-making itself and the boundary of illusion and reality. I’m not including films by the Iranian-born Barbet Schroeder but i am including some films on Iranian subjects by Iranian directors working elsewhere.</p>\n<p><strong>Reading</strong>:<br>\n<strong>Mehrnaz Saeed-Vafa, Jonathan Rosenbaum: Abbas Kiarostami</strong><br>\n<strong>Hamid Dabashi: Close Up: Iranian Cinema, Past, Present and Future</strong><br>\n<strong>Hamid Dabashi: Masters and Masterpieces of Iranian Cinema</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_Iran\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia: Cinema of Iran</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbas_Kiarostami\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia: Abbas Kiarostami</a></p>\n<p><sub>~</sub></p>\n<p>There have been numerous female directors, including some of the most prominent  overall; Forough Farrokhzad, Rakshan Bani-Etemad, Samira and Hana Makhmalbaf, Marzieh Meshkini/Makhmalbaf, Sadaf Foroughi…. and also Marjane Satrapi, Shirin Neshat, Ziba Mir-Hosseini and Mehrnaz Saeed-Vafa based abroad, whose Iranian-set films i’m including in this list.</p>\n<p>The list below is in year order, and i’ve included a few major films i’ve yet to see.</p>\n<p>My favourites:<br>\nThrough the Olive Trees, Gabbeh, And Life Goes On, Brick and Mirror, Close Up, The White Balloon, Bashu the Little Stranger, Taxi, Fireworks Wednesday.</p>\n<p>See also Arsaib’s excellent list <a href=\"http://mubi.com/lists/Sohrab-Shahid-Saless\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sohrab Shahid Saless</a> about the Iranian director who went on to make radical films in West Germany but who has never received due attention either in that country or in general studies internationally of Iranian cinema.</p>\n<p>Oh and do read My Uncle Napoleon, one of my favourite novels.</p>",

Alice Guy-Blaché was one of the great pioneers of cinema, made hundreds of films, the first in 1896, before Méliès. Do check her out, there is skill and charm aplenty: I’ve done a list <a href=\"http://mubi.com/lists/alice-guy-blache-queen-of-the-pioneers\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alice Guy-Blaché, Queen of the Pioneers</a>. In 1910s Hollywood, in films like Suspense, Lois Weber matched Griffith for panache. Lotte Reiniger was a pioneering feature film animator in the 1920s, with her silhouettes in The Adventures of Prince Achmed,  while Germaine Dulac is widely credited with the first Surrealist film, The Seashell and the Clergyman (1928). Before Fantasia’s animated abstract Bach Fugue there was Mary Ellen Bute’s. Maya Deren was very influential on the post-war American avant-garde, though i must say her husband Alexander Hammid, who co-directed Meshes of the Afternoon, deserves more recognition too. Marie Menken is described by our great list-maker Grey Daisies as the unsung heroine of the avant-garde. Agnes Varda is the mother of the French New Wave, Chantal Akerman surely a major director, Jeanne Dielman one of the great minimalist films. The Bulgarian Binka Zheliazkova’s The Attached Balloon is just one of various neglected treasures by women. In notoriously patriarchal Iran, there have been several prominent female directors, putting Hollywood to shame. Often female co-directors get overlooked; Miéville with Godard, Ágnes Hranitzky with Bela Tarr, Evelyn Lambart with Norman McLaren, Katia Lund with Meirelles, Charlotte Zwerin with the Maysles….</p>\n<p>This site is honoured to have Chantal Akerman, Maria de Medeiros, Sally Potter, Julie Dash, Sadaf Foroughi, Allison Anders, Ava DuVernay among the users. Sally Potter has even done a list, My Teachers, as has Julie Dash. And good to have Agnes Varda’s liaison with the site and her films being championed so successfully. <a href=\"https://mubi.com/lists/the-essential-agnes-varda\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Essential Agnes Varda</a> .</p>\n<p>With uncertainty, I’m not including films by Lilly and Lana Wachowski who made their name when officially male, before their transgender assignments.</p>",

Blessed land of warmth and beauty, in its people as well as climate and landscape! Land of discoverers and worthy of discovery. When in Portugal, like the poet Pessoa, tenho em mim todos os sonhos do mundo/ i have in me all the dreams of the world.</p>\n<p>The great director <a href=\"http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2008/03/27/oliveira460.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">Manoel de Oliveira</a>, a colossus of Portuguese cinema, was still prolific up to his death aged 106, well into his 10th different decade of film-making! R.I.P.</p>\n<p>Manoel de Oliveira was born in Porto, Portugal on December 11, 1908, to Francisco José de Oliveira and Cândida Ferreira Pinto. His family were wealthy industrialists and agricultural landowners. He attended school in Galicia, Spain and his goal, as a teenager, was to become an actor. He enrolled in Italian film-maker Rino Lupo’s acting school at age 20, but later changed his mind when he saw Walther Ruttmann’s documentary Berlin: Symphony of a City. This prompted him to direct his first film, also a documentary, titled Douro, Faina Fluvial (1931). He also has the distinction of having acted in the second Portuguese sound film, A Canção de Lisboa (1933).</p>\n<p>His first feature film came much later, in 1942. Aniki-Bóbó, a portrait of Oporto’s street children, was a commercial failure when it opened, and its merit only came to be recognised over time. This drawback forced Manoel de Oliveira to abandon other film projects he was involved in, and to dedicate himself to running his family vineyard. He re-emerged onto the film scene in 1956 with The Artist and the City, a work that marked a turning point in Oliveira’s conception of the cinema.</p>\n<p>In 1963, O Acto de Primavera (The Rite of Spring), a documentary depicting an annual passion play, marked a turning point for his career. This was shortly followed by A caça (The Hunt), a grim feature film that contrasted with the happy tones of his previous documentary. Despite the widespread acclaim garnered by both films, he would not return to the director’s seat until the 1970s. Since 1990 (when he turned 82), he has made at least one film each year. His film, Christopher Columbus – the Enigma (2007), was shot partly in New York.</p>\n<p>Manoel de Oliveira has said that he directs movies for the sheer pleasure of it, regardless of critical reaction. He maintains a quiet life away from the spotlights.</p>\n<p>In 2008, Oliveira was awarded a doctorate degree honoris causa by the University of the Algarve. He has also been awarded the Order of St. James of the Sword by the President of Portugal. In addition, he has received multiple honours such as those of the Cannes, Venice and Montréal film festivals. He has been awarded two Career Golden Lions, in 1985 and 2004, and a Golden Palm for his lifetime achievements in 2008.</p>\n<p>Manoel de Oliveira married Maria Isabel Brandão de Meneses de Almeida Carvalhais in Porto on December 4, 1940. They have two children: Manuel Casimiro Brandão Carvalhais de Oliveira (born 1941) and Adelaide Maria Brandão Carvalhais de Oliveira (born 1948). He has several grandchildren through his daughter Adelaide.</p>\n<p>He was not only a film director. He also competed as a race car driver in his younger days. In the 1937 Grand Prix season he competed in and won the International Estoril Circuit race, driving a Ford V8 Special.</p>\n<p>Manoel de Oliveira was chosen to give the welcoming speech at Pope Benedict XVI’s meeting with representatives of the Portuguese cultural world on 12 May 2010 at the Belém Cultural Center. In the speech, titled “Religion and Art”, he said that morality and art may well have derived from the religious attempt at “a explanation of the existence of human beings” with regard to their “concrete insertion in the Cosmos”. The arts “have always been strictly linked to religions” and Christianity has been “prodigal in artistic expressions”. In an interview published the day before, Oliveira, who was raised a Catholic, said that, “doubts or not, the religious aspect of life has always accompanied me,” and added, “All my films are religious.”<br>\n(wikipedia)</p>\n<p><sub>~</sub></p>\n<p>Another top director, <a href=\"http://imagens4.publico.pt/imagens.aspx/810654?tp=UH&amp;amp;db=IMAGENS&amp;amp;w=749\" rel=\"nofollow\">João César Monteiro</a> .</p>\n<p>João César Monteiro (1939-2003) was born in Figueira da Foz, a cosmopolitan beach resort in Portugal and moved to Lisbon at the age of 15 where he continued his studies.</p>\n<p>João César Monteiro remains among the most indelible and unusual figures in the history of Portuguese cinema, a visionary and profoundly eccentric filmmaker whose unique contribution to postwar European film is only gradually being recognized today. A cosmopolite imagination tethered by a provincial attachment to Lisbon, a libertine with an obscurely puritanical streak, an unrelenting aesthete guided by an archaic spirit – Monteiro was a deliberately contradictory and difficult artist who obdurately resisted affiliation with any declared “school” of filmmaking. Monteiro dedicated himself instead to a mode of sublimely, and often perversely, high modernism fascinated by a rich undercurrent between the cinema and the other arts – especially poetry, painting, theater, literature and music. Like the films of his compatriot Manoel de Oliveira (b. 1908), Monteiro’s cinema was also animated by an alternately cryptic and trenchant political agenda that took frequent target at the holy trinity of Church, State and Family still firmly entrenched after the fall of the Salazar dictatorship. In such seminal early works as Paths and Silvestre, Monteiro treated obscure Portuguese myths and legends as Rosetta stones for understanding the darkest shadows of the national unconscious and suggesting the ways in which the country’s imperialist and patriarchal legacies continue to shape its citizens. In opulent late works like God’s Comedy and Come and Go, Monteiro channeled his lasting preoccupation with corporality and perverse sexuality into a sustained interrogation of individual agency and collective desire.</p>\n<p>Raised in a devoutly Catholic family yet an avowed atheist as an adult, in many of his late films Monteiro cast himself in the recurrent leading role of “Joao do Deus”- named after the Portuguese-born patron saint of prostitutes, the infirm and fishermen but a wholly secular figure, a perverse Buster Keaton-like dreamer drawn to young women and possessed of a patient defiance of the established social order. A curious religious logic also guided the development of Monteiro’s extraordinary visual style, which moved from the radical mise-en-scene of the early work towards an increasing austerity shaped, above all, by Monteiro’s proclaimed distrust of artificial light – which reached its apotheosis in Snow White – and his desire to capture the effulgent mystery of sunlight and its shadows.</p>\n<p>His work, polemic and hard to classify, has a lyric quality that some identify as “film-poem”, however his work is often satirical and cynical. He plays the principal character in many of his films. His work has been the subject of study by Portuguese and international critics and <br>\nacademicians, and he is recognized, along with Manoel de Oliveira, as a giant of Portuguese cinema<br>\n(Harvard Film Archive)</p>\n<p>Monteiro won Mubi’s 2nd Directors Cup!</p>\n<p><sub>~</sub></p>\n<p>This list is in year order (or will be fully when a glitch is sorted), including some set in Portugal by non-Portuguese directors too. .</p>\n<p>My favourites: <strong>Abraham Valley</strong>, <strong>Mysteries of Lisbon</strong> <strong>Aniki Bobo</strong>, <strong>Silvestre</strong>, <strong>Tabu</strong>.</p>\n<p>Hats off to the extraordinary prolific late Chilean director Raul Ruiz, who though mainly based in France seems to have made Portugal something of a cinematic second or third home.

My first memory of going to the cinema was Fantasia – my introduction to the devil and dinosaurs. My small town’s cinema closed when i was 7- TV was too strong a competitor-, my sole memory of  films there are of “red Indians” on a hill. The bigger films were at the grand metropolis of the county town of 3,000 people 20 miles away, or an even greater city of a few thousand more in the other direction. How i wept when the child catcher caught them in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, and the sky outside had changed, with castles hidden in the majestic domes of cumulo-nimbus. At 11, The Great Escape was the greatest adventure, at 12, El Cid. At 13, i joined the school film society. I gazed at the naked female on a motorbike in Vanishing Point- more fun than that boring Wild Strawberries (which I still can’t take to). In my mid teens, the best discoveries were North by Northwest and Fred Astaire. At uni, on a French course, my special subject was French Cinema of the 30s- Renoir and Pagnol..- but i really got obsessively hooked on world cinema once i’d bought a video player in the late 80s (those Wenders road movies!) and John Kobal’s book The Top 100 Movies (see my list on that); Seven Samurai and 2001 inspired awe, while Tarkovsky and Mizoguchi were new names to me. Soon i saw Andrei Rublev and the rain and light had changed. Then a few years on (much less availability in those days) it was the turn of Sansho the Bailiff.\n<p><sub>~</sub></p>\n<p>I’ve been asked to do a list of all my lists, but that would take time and anyway would get jumbled in with the others. So here are the ones i like and the most popular.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mubi.com/lists/kenjis-japanese-canon\" rel=\"nofollow\">Essential Japanese Films</a> ,<br>\n<a href=\"http://mubi.com/lists/essential-films-by-women\" rel=\"nofollow\">Essential Films by Women</a> ,<br>\n<a href=\"http://mubi.com/lists/19805\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Labyrinth</a> ,<br>\n<a href=\"http://mubi.com/lists/973\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Mubi/Auteurs World Cup Films</a> ,<br>\n<a href=\"http://mubi.com/lists/the-welsh-connection\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Welsh Connection</a> ,<br>\n<a href=\"http://mubi.com/lists/4775\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mizoguchi Revered</a> ,<br>\n<a href=\"https://mubi.com/lists/let-there-be-light-the-birth-of-films-to-1899\" rel=\"nofollow\">Let There be Light: The Birth of Films</a> ,<br>\n<a href=\"https://mubi.com/lists/notable-films-by-black-directors\" rel=\"nofollow\">Notable Films by Black Directors</a> ,<br>\n<a href=\"https://mubi.com/lists/essayists-diarists-musersfunambulists-of-free-thought\" rel=\"nofollow\">Essayists, Diarists, Musers..Funambulists of Free Thought</a> , <br>\n<a href=\"http://mubi.com/lists/7258\" rel=\"nofollow\">A Rosefinch Sang: the Czechoslovakian New Wave</a> ,<br>\n<a href=\"https://mubi.com/lists/kenji-s-own-haiku-treasury\" rel=\"nofollow\">My Haiku</a> ,<br>\n<a href=\"http://mubi.com/lists/19th-century-britain\" rel=\"nofollow\">19th Century Britain</a> ,<br>\n<a href=\"http://mubi.com/lists/essential-french-films\" rel=\"nofollow\">Essential French Films</a> ,<br>\n<a href=\"https://mubi.com/lists/101-directors-essential-films\" rel=\"nofollow\">100 Directors’ Essential Films</a> ,<br>\n<a href=\"http://mubi.com/lists/Essential-African-Films\" rel=\"nofollow\">Essential African Films</a> ,<br>\n<a href=\"https://mubi.com/lists/portugal-land-of-my-dreams\" rel=\"nofollow\">Portugal, Land of My Dreams</a> ,<br>\n<a href=\"http://mubi.com/lists/they-do-not-exist-palestine\" rel=\"nofollow\">They Do Not Exist: Palestine</a> ,<br>\n<a href=\"https://mubi.com/lists/lesotho\" rel=\"nofollow\">We Love Lesotho</a> ,<br>\n<a href=\"https://mubi.com/lists/favourite-indian-films\" rel=\"nofollow\">India</a> ,<br>\n<a href=\"https://mubi.com/lists/essential-iranian-films\" rel=\"nofollow\">Essential Iranian Films</a> ,<br>\n<a href=\"https://mubi.com/lists/turkey\" rel=\"nofollow\">Essential Turkish Films</a> ,<br>\n<a href=\"https://mubi.com/lists/101-favourite-documentaries\" rel=\"nofollow\">Essential Documentaries</a> ,<br>\n<a href=\"http://mubi.com/lists/favourite-short-films\" rel=\"nofollow\">Essential Short Films &amp; Featurettes</a> ,<br>\n<a href=\"https://mubi.com/lists/favourite-animations\" rel=\"nofollow\">Essential Animation</a> ,<br>\n<a href=\"http://mubi.com/lists/hidden-treasures\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hidden Treasures</a> ,<br>\n<a href=\"https://mubi.com/lists/le-cinema-cest-jean-renoir\" rel=\"nofollow\">Le Cinema, c’est Jean Renoir</a> ,<br>\n<a href=\"http://mubi.com/lists/satyajit-ray--3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Satyajit Ray</a> ,<br>\n<a href=\"https://mubi.com/lists/kubrick--14\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kubrick, With A-Z Guide</a> ,<br>\n<a href=\"https://mubi.com/lists/essential-hitchcock\" rel=\"nofollow\">Essential Hitchcock, With A-Z Guide</a> ,<br>\n<a href=\"https://mubi.com/lists/eric-rohmer--3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eric Rohmer &amp; His Legacy</a> ,<br>\n<a href=\"https://mubi.com/lists/essential-godard--2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Essential Godard: More Than a List</a> ,<br>\n<a href=\"https://mubi.com/lists/leftist-films\" rel=\"nofollow\">Leftist Films</a> ,<br>\n<a href=\"https://mubi.com/lists/great-cinematographers\" rel=\"nofollow\">Great Cinematographers</a> ,<br>\n<a href=\"https://mubi.com/lists/films-admired-by-tarkovsky\" rel=\"nofollow\">Films Admired by Tarkovsky</a> ,<br>\n<a href=\"https://mubi.com/lists/susan-sontags-favourite-films\" rel=\"nofollow\">Susan Sontag’s Favourite Films</a> ,<br>\n<a href=\"https://mubi.com/lists/mental-illness\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mental Health</a> ,<br>\n<a href=\"https://mubi.com/lists/films-about-film--4\" rel=\"nofollow\">Films about Film</a> .<br>\n<a href=\"https://mubi.com/lists/painters-and-films\" rel=\"nofollow\">Painters and Films</a> ,<br>\n<a href=\"https://mubi.com/lists/kenjis-poetry-anthology-part-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kenji’s Poetry Anthology 1</a> ,<br>\n<a href=\"https://mubi.com/lists/kenjis-poetry-anthology-part-2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kenji’s Poetry Anthology 2</a></p>",
